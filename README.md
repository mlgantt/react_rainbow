# react_rainbow
A Rainbow generator using ReactJS


Here is my Rainbow React project. The app generates a rainbow that animates onto the screen and is completly responsive. I used the 88mph Yeoman Generator to start up my local project.

Get Started:

Clone the repo and run 'npm install'.

Run 'gulp serve' to build the project and start the server.
